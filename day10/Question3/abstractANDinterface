Q3) Explain abstract class and interface with an example.

sol:  Abstract class---------

      1>Abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
      2>Abstract class is use to achieve Abstraction
        ex-- abstract class Animal {
                public abstract void animalSound();
                      public void sleep() {
                      System.out.println("Zzz");
                 }
              }
              
              
       Interface----------
       
       An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class.
       It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface. 
       Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
       Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. 
       
       for ex-       interface Animal {
                        public void eat();
                        public void travel(); 
                     }
